Léthé Texture format

This file contain specification for Léthé texture format,
Léthé engine use custom texture file; this file describe
how the format works; see the end of the file for details
about format revisions.

This file is provide as a helper to understand the format,
no information about the huffman algorithm or any other
algorithm implementation was provide; the information
provide here was just a study case.

Basicly Léthé texture files as the extension ltf; but
like any other format; extension don't defined the
file content, just a visual help to tell file usage.

The Léthé texture file was compose of two main section,
the file header and content; the file header was compose
of seven blocs and file content was split on equal blocs.

File header structure :
  | bloc name | bloc size | bloc use
  |-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
  |    TGI    |     1     | Store generator id        |
  |    TWI    |     4     | Store texture width       |
  |    THI    |     4     | Store texture height      |
  |    TSI    |     4     | Store texture size        |
  |    BLI    |     2     | Store content blob length |
  |    BCI    |     4     | Srote content blob count  |
  |    HSI    |     4     | Store HTI size            |
  |    HTI    |   [HSI]   | Store huffman tree        |
  |-----------|-----------|---------------------------|

  For TGI equal to 0x10, the header was not compressed,
  for other TGI look under for details about header
  compression.

  The TSI value is equal to TWI * THI * 4; the constant
  4 is used to defined the 4 channels of RGBA pixels.

  The BLI value defined the size for blob data of the
  content blocs.

  The BCI value is equal to TSI / BLI; if BCI * BLI is
  not equal to TSI; the last bloc of content section
  was not entirely used.

File content bloc strucuture :
  | bloc name | bloc size | bloc use
  |-----------|-----------|------------------------|
  |    CSI    |     4     | Store blob start info. |
  |    CDI    |   [BLI]   | Store blob data        |
  |    CEI    |     4     | Store blob end info.   |
  |-----------|-----------|------------------------|

  For TGI equal to 0x10, the content was just a blob
  of compressed data; no chunk or sum to ensure the
  data viability.

  From TGI equal 0x11 to 0x?? :
    - CSI is equal to the check sum value for the blob.
    - CEI is equal to CSI; CEI is used for redundancy;
      if CSI and CEI not equal or the check sum of the
      blob not equal to CSI; the blob was aletred and
      not usable.

Format revision history:
    1.1 : ( 2018-??-?? ) Update file strucuture :
                  - Add data to the header.
                  - Add blob support for content bloc.
    1.0 : ( 2018-11-03 ) First version of the format.
